# project_notary_n8_prime
This project has been a challenge and I'm still working on it but I do believe that this version meets the following requirements
Navigation menu that expands an collapses depending on media querie
Hamburger Animation that goes from 3 lines to 'X' when clicked with slide animation
Enter button displays total amount
Stores Form Data into Local Memory

Thanks for the oppurtunity and hopefully this project will pass so that I can continue learning
In any regards, it's been a blast
